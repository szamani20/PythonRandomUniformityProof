**Python random uniformity**
----------------------------
I used `numpy` and `matploylib` to prove that python random generating is completely uniform!  
The only difference here is that i used graphical interface to show how the random numbers are generated thanks to extremely helpful Python library `matplotlib`.  
Here is a photo of the result:
